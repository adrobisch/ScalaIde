# ScalaIde

Is a web-based IDE for the Scala Language. For the frontend html5 is used, especially websockets in the backend the play framework is used, which is implemented in Scala.

It is originated as a teamproject at the department of computer science at [University of Applied Sciences, Constance, Germany](http://www.htwg-konstanz.de/).

Thanks to [Dirk](https://github.com/dirkmc/ph), he had previously implemented the compiler-thing. We ported it to Play 2.0.

## Run It

Change in `conf/application.conf` the variable `framework.directory` to the play-main-folder.

```
git clone git://github.com/themerius/ScalaIde.git
cd ScalaIde
play run

Open your websocket-ready browser at `http://localhost:9000`.

You will be asked if you want to create the bootstrap database, with three default users:

  * lars@test.de, password = 123
  * sven@test.de, password = 123

If you want to create the database direcly, call play like this:
